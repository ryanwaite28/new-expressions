# New Expressions

Clothing Website that i made. Using Bootstrap Framework. Nowhere NEAR done! Shopping Cart Functionality coming soon.
Learning Server Side Scripting (Python, Ruby, PHP, SQL, etc...). 

Right Now, only "Top" is filled out; i'm working on the rest, pieces at a time. All pages are linked together.
Also have to style it for mobile view. Planning on using jQuery to implement those features.
